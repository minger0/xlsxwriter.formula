# troubleshooting
Libreoffice calc does not recalculate formulas by default. You can either enable auto-recalculation in Tools/Options/LibreOffice Calc/Formula/Excel 2007 and Newer/Always recalculate, or just press [Ctrl-Shift-F9](https://help.libreoffice.org/6.3/en-US/text/scalc/01/06080000.html?DbPAR=CALC).
